						Origin

						The analysis of public genome sequence data
						from SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses found no evidence that the virus was made in a
						laboratory or otherwise engineered. "By comparing the available genome sequence data
						for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through
						natural processes," said Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and
						microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper. In addition to Andersen,
						authors on the paper, "The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2," include Robert F. Garry, of Tulane University;
						Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney; Andrew Rambaut, of University of Edinburgh; W. Ian Lipkin, of
						Columbia University. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in
						severity. The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus emerged with the 2003 Severe Acute
						Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China. A second outbreak of severe illness began in 2012 in
						Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). On December 31 of last year, Chinese
						authorities alerted the World Health Organization of an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus
						ausing severe illness, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. As of February 20, 2020, nearly 167,500
						COVID-19 cases have been documented, although many more mild cases have likely gone undiagnosed. The virus
						has killed over 6,600 people. Shortly after the epidemic began, Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of
						SARS-CoV-2 and made the data available to researchers worldwide. The resulting genomic sequence data has shown
						that Chinese authorities rapidly detected the epidemic and that the number of COVID-19 cases have been increasing
						because of human to human transmission after a single introduction into the human population. Andersen
						and collaborators at several other research institutions used this sequencing data to explore the origins
						and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing in on several tell-tale features of the virus. The scientists analyzed
						the genetic template for spike proteins, armatures on the outside of the virus that it uses to grab and
						penetrate the outer walls of human and animal cells. More specifically, they focused on two important
						features of the spike protein: the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a kind of grappling hook that grips
						onto host cells, and the cleavage site, a molecular can opener that allows the virus to crack open and
						enter host cells.
